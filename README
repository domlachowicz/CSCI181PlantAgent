Peter was here... CS181 final project release:

client/player.{c,py} -- the provided interactive player.  You should
                        modify/create a new player.
shared/*             -- support code that you shouldn't need to change
game-nice            -- binary for running the game on
                        nice.fas.harvard.edu
game-OSX             -- binary for running the game on OS X (intel)

Run the game without arguments to see possible arguments.

Good luck!
